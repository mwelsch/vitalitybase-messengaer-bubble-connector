ToDo: proper documentation, comments, errorhandling, search for ToDos in all files andfix em, add facebook messanger
deployment and stuff
proper -v on docker for persistency stuff (session files, logs)
if the api key / id / hash is not valid we need proper error msgs
properly close event loops, connections, logs and everything, so we do not have to restart the server
